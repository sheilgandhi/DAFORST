# Personas

Having a spectrum of personas is important when it comes to User Experience Engineering. A spectrum is important as it allows us to have an open mind and consider many use cases for our decentralised app (Dapp). In this case, a Dapp is a new concept to a lot of people. Individuals may not know anything about Dapps, Web3, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency or NFTs. Therefore, it is important to better understand all types of people who exist across a spectrum.
