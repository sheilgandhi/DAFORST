# Scenarios

These scenarios are developed from Alan Cooper book, About Face 3. In his book, Cooper defines two methodologies for developing persona-based scanerios. The two methods are Requirements Defintion and Framework Definition. The Requirements Definition answers questions at a higher level about a product and what it should do. Whereas, the Framework Definition answers questions at the low-level about how the product behaves and how it is structured. The model being used is the former, the Requirements Defintion. This method is more useful as the product being developed is new. The development process is comprised of five steps:

1. Creating problem and vision statements
2. Brainstorming
3. Identifying persona expectations
4. Constructing context scenarios  
  4.1. In what setting(s) will the product be used?  
  4.2. Will it be used for extended amounts of time?  
  4.3. Is the persona frequently interrupted?  
  4.4. Are there multiple users on a single workstation or device?  
  4.5. With what other products will it be used?  
  4.6. What primary activities does the persona need to perform to meet her goals?  
  4.7. What is the expected end result of using the product?  
  4.8. How much complexity is permissible, based on persona skill and frequency of use?
5. Identifying requirements

Having performed these steps, an overview is created about how a user will address their goals in the form of a context scenario. This would be a good prelude to the Framework Definition, if the product, DAFORST, is to be further developed beyond the scope of the project.

## Che Daniels

#### Goal:
The design of DAFORST will help Che Daniels achieve his goal of digitising assets at his volunteering by giving them the ability to upload and retrieve information about their assets with greater data sovereignty and asset protection, without the problems that current centralised solutions currently experience.

#### Scenario:
While working at the community center, Che uses his phone to take pictures of sculptures. He has the latest Samsung phone, so it's fast and has a quality camera. This makes using the Dapp more efficient than using a DSLR Camera and gathering pictures off there. Che has all these images of sculptures sitting on his phone and needs to upload them with the right information. Che cannot upload multiple assets at once, so he needs to upload 10 sculptures one-by-one. Each upload should only take a couple of minutes as he has to ask the community for the specific information. Whilst entering information about the asset, Che looks up at the person he is talking to and continues to fill in the information. Che is the only person interacting with his phone. Other devices with DAFORST will be able to view all assets, as there is no access control. No other activities are required for the Dapp to perform the upload. Che expects with each sculpture uploaded to be able to view it on the Assets page, of the app. From there he can tap on the asset to get all the information about it. Che expects the whole experience to be quick and straight forward, so he can get on to helping others and not become tech-support or get stuck in a rabbit-hole of questions about how to use the Dapp.

## Karen Mount

#### Goal:
The design of DAFORST will help Karen Mount achieve her goal of teaching other communities how to protect their assets online by giving them the knowledge about DAFORST and how it will benefit their assets online with greater understanding about data sovereignty and asset protection, without the problems that these communities currently experience.

#### Scenario:
Whilst having a community at the Library in Christchurch, Karen demonstrates DAFORST in a group setting. She has Hauwei phone with a large screen, screen mirroring on to a large TV. Karen wants to demonstrate how the community can upload a photo and take a photo of their assets and upload them. This may take longer than a couple of minutes for each method of upload, as she is dicussing and interacting with the community. Whilst presenting, Karen frequently looks away from her phone to look at her audience and interact with them. Karen is the only one using her phone but can be influenced since many others can see her screen. Other devices with DAFORST will be able to view all assets, as there is no access control. No other activities are required for the Dapp to perform the upload. Karen expects with each example she's demonstrated to be able to view it on the Assets page, of the app. From there everyone in the community, with the DAFORST Dapp, can tap on the asset to get all the information about it. Karen expects the Dapp to be clear after one demonstration to all community members and hopes the second methodology will reinforce the idea on "How to use DAFORST?".

## Imiri Ioane

#### Goal:
The design of DAFORST will help Imiri Ioane achieve her goal of digitising her flowers with her gardening club by giving them the ability to upload and retrieve information about their flowers whilst not giving away ownership of her flowers, without the problems Imiri faces on a daily basis with technology.

#### Scenario:
Whilst gardening at her local community garden with her club, Amiri is told by the president of the club to digitise her roses. Amiri has a cheap Vodafone phone from 2018, so the camera is not up-to-date but is still high quality. Amiri pulls her phone out, opens the app and goes through the flow. She had to ask her president once for help. This took her a few minutes to do. Amiri looked away once to see who was close to her to ask them for help. Amiri and the person who helped her are the only ones to have interacted with her phone. Other devices with DAFORST will be able to view all assets, as there is no access control. No other activities are required for the Dapp to perform the upload. Amiri expects it to all be handled by the Dapp and then show her gardening club that she uploaded her roses. If Amiri has to use the Dapp multiple times, which see should expect as she grows more flowers, it should be as easy the social media apps she's more comfortable with.
