# DREAD Analysis

DREAD is a risk assessment model, which is used to prioritise security threats. Developed by Microsoft, like STRIDE, DREAD is an acronym for each potential risk factor: Damage potential, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, and Discoverability. Each risk factor is given a score from 1 to 10. The higher the score, the more risk for a threat, which in turn gives that threat a higher priority.

Damage potential refers to the level of damage that could be done to the users, organisation, and other stakeholders should the attack succeed. For example, an attack on a single user is low, but an entire system is high. The level is also determined by the type of attack and/or asset being targeted. Damage can be concrete, abstract, financial or even reputational.

Reproducibility is a measure of how simple and easy an attack is to reproduce. For example, an attack reproduced reliably is high, whereas, one statistically low or one that cannot be reproduced consistently is low.

Exploitability is the measure of how difficult it is to exploit the vulnerability. For example, a low-level exploit would be difficult to execute even with knowledge of the vulnerability. Some exploits can be performed by unauthenticated users but others require special tools, advanced techniques, scripts, or programs.

Affected Users refer to the percentage of users affected by the threat. For example, the more users affected, the greater the risk.

Discoverability is a measure of how easy the vulnerability is to learn about. For example, a threat that is difficult to uncover would represent a low risk. However, one which is in the public domain would be high risk.

META is considered the response to threats. Once DREAD has been performed for a threat, the appropriate response must be formed. META is an acronym for each response: Mitigation, Elimination, Transfer of risk, and Acceptance of risk. Mitigation involves implementing an appropriate security control. The goal is to eliminate or reduce the damage caused by the vulnerability. Elimination requires engineers to implement a solution so that the vulnerability no longer exists. Transfer of risk involves shifting the risk to a third party. This can be done through insurance policies or contracts. Acceptance of risk is simply accepting the risk. If the DREAD prioritisation is low and the effort to mitigate is greater than the risk, it's maybe decided to accept the risk.
